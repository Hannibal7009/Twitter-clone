# Twitter-Clone

A sample web page of twitter.
Let's make simple Twitter. Users can post tweets and see everyone's post.
To make the project simple, we do not have a sign in/login function.
So there are no user accounts and follow function.
Check out [LIVE DEMO here!!](https://twitter-clone-andrewcrouch.herokuapp.com/)
